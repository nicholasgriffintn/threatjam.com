# ThreatJam

ThreatJam is an app for running collaborative threat modelling sessions using C4 diagrams.

I wanted to create a simple, open-source solution that you can use to run your own sessions, either at [threatjam.com](https://threatjam.com) or by hosting it on Cloudflare yourself.

> **Note:** I made a lot of this with AI, on my phone. It almost certainly has bugs, feel free to raise a PR if you find any.
