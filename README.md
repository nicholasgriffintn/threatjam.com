# SprintJam

SprintJam is an app for agile teams looking to run story pointing sessions in the style of Planning Poker.

I decided to do this because I was fed up of using solutions full of ads and trackers.

This is a simple, open-source solution that you can use to run your own sessions, either at [sprintjam.co.uk](https://sprintjam.co.uk) or by hosting it on Cloudflare yourself.

> **Note:** I made this on a train with AI, on my phone. It almost certainly has bugs, feel free to raise a PR if you find any.
